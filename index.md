## About Me
I'm a bit of a jack-of-all-trades and have worked with a plethora of technologies from a consumption and configuration perspective.

- .NET
- SQL
- PHP

  - Galera Cluster

  - Swarm

## Employment Status
I am on a semi-hiatus from the corporate world. After spending about 20 years in various roles, I've stepped into an instructor role teaching a Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University in Chicago. This has been quite a fulfilling experience while giving me time to work on other projects.

## Current Projects
My development time is spread around various projects that I'm attempting to push toward the finish line.

- [gnostic.ai](https://gnostic.ai) - An automated machine learning platform.
- [Traveeta](https://traveeta.com) - A niche community that matches you with your ideal travel partner.
- [BNB Host Guru](https://bnbhost.guru) - A service that makes handling multiple short-term rental properties less painful.
